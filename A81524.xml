            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">1) <hi>Note, the Original and moving cause wherefore the State apprehended them. Not onely had these men &amp;c, but withal had made a Traiterous BookâThis being [known] the Parliament gave Commission and Order unto the Councel of State [for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending and securing of those Mutineers.] The Councel ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly appointed some Officers of the Army to see the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments command executed,</hi> &amp;c.â <hi>the which done, and the Persons brought before the Councel, it was shewed them (by the Lord Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident) by what Authority they were sent for, and the Reason why,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vind.</hi> How <hi>imperfect</hi> the Relation is, let every one judge, that knows, or hath heard the proceedings reported. How <hi>untrue,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:172843:10"/>you'l see by laying parallel to it, the Presidents words, to wit, <hi>This Councel having information that you have a principal hand in compiling and promoting this Book, and the Parliament having referred the enquiry after the authors and publishers to this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel; therefore they have sent for you.</hi> And remembring the <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for Commitment</hi> run thusâ<hi>upon suspition of high Treason,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2) <hi>For their Answer,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Discoverer.</note> We must expect <hi>shortly</hi> a further <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>The next place unto which they bring us, is the Councel of War, and say.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>By their means, after these fair blossoms of hopeful liberty, breaks forth this bitter fruit of the vilest and basest bondage, that ever English men groaned under.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Answ. 1. <hi>When it is to plead for mutinous Souldiers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>we shall hear them speak of good daies, times of Peace, all Courts of Iustice open (vid.</hi> the letter of two of them) <hi>but if it be to reproach the Army, they can make their tongues to say quite contrary, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but bondage</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>new Chain p.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vind.</hi> The man deals but dis-ingeniously, never tells us what this <hi>better fruit,</hi> &amp;c. which these men (are said to) except against, and which praecedes this citation without mean, was, whereby his <hi>Reader</hi> might have at hand, before his eyes, the matter he is to judge of, to <hi>censure,</hi> or <hi>acquit.</hi> For this his common trick, he may be called the <hi>Concealer, vid.</hi> pag. 30, 38.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He is so cross, hee'l make <hi>Contraries</hi> of <hi>Convenients.</hi> Hear them,</p>

               <hi>Gross contradiction</hi> (for so he calls it) where lurkest thou, lyest thou hid? Come, Ã´ man of <hi>Confidence (vid. Conclusion</hi> of his book) come with thy further <hi>Discovery,</hi> for this doth not make her appear.âIf I look for it, it shall be at the <hi>catch</hi> of <hi>Opposition</hi> betwixt <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Bondage.</hi> And if I find it not there, the Reader must know he is to turn <hi>Seeker,</hi> if she be <hi>finde-able;</hi> if <hi>not,</hi> then <hi>Expectant</hi> till the next <hi>Discoverer</hi> come. â Token.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. He is here quite beside the Saddle with a piece of the L. Col. letter; which being matter of report, which I cannot enquire about, Ile onely say, the Reader may in the <hi>Concessions</hi> of the <hi>Discoverer,</hi> have enough to complain of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Another cause of their complaint,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Discoverer.</note>
               <hi>is, that such Petitioners as have moved in the behalf of the People, have had their Petitions burnt by the common-hang-man. Likewise, for passng an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for Tythes upon treble damages.</hi> New Chain, 1. p. 7. &amp; 2. p. 4.</p>
            <p>Answ. <hi>The Persons whom they do accuse all along, naming a prevailing power in the Army</hi> &amp;c. <hi>they have not had a hand in the things whereof they accuse them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vind.</hi> Its openly laid before us in the begining of that <hi>Section,</hi> in the first part, that its the <hi>House,</hi> not their <hi>Army,</hi> is blamed. And in 2. part, the <hi>Authors</hi> charge upon them, the <hi>passing this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> no otherwise, than <hi>as they (contrary to the importunate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of the Agitators, and Remonstrance of the Army) permitted the conjunction of the Æ²surpers, to those guarded to their places, One of the first fruits whereof was this Ordinance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly,
<note place="margin">Discoverer.</note>
               <hi>There are many other accusations of this nature brought against the Councel of War, and Commanders of the Army, of all which we shall speak in our next Discovery.</hi> The <hi>one thing more, is toucht</hi> before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vind.</hi> Now Reader, recollect your thoughts, and seriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, whether he, who is so vain, so false in his tongue, and noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a make-bate, is to be heard, and not answered, reproved? Whether this <hi>unus ex plebe,</hi> (in our Common-wealth) be fit to sit a Judge, and sentence such men as these? and, Whether he hath cleerly demonstrated, by Reason and proof abundantly, that <hi>they have done already that for which they ought to suffer death?</hi> as he (out of the abundance of his heart) saith, p. 33. like the <hi>Priests,</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>all the People,</hi> against <hi>Ieremy,</hi> Cap. XXVI, <hi>v.</hi> 8.11.</p>
